# Linear-Regression-Project
## Statistical Data Analysis of Alcohol Consumption &amp; Life Expectancy Data
The objective of this project is to determine if there is a correlation between per capita alcohol consumption in Europe and two variables: a countryâ€™s GDP growth (% annual) and life expectancy. We all have heard anecdotally that alcohol negatively impacts health, and our assumption is that this relationship would appear in life expectancy data. According to the World Health Organization, alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions. It is estimated that 3 million deaths result from the harmful use of alcohol every year (World Health Organization, 2008). To test multivariable modelling, an additional parameter was selected that could potentially impact life expectancy and alcohol consumption, GDP growth to include in analysis.
The original objective of analysis was to understand the interactions between GDP growth, life expectancy and alcohol consumption. Initial prediction was that alcohol consumption would negatively impact life expectancy and that GDP growth would positively impact alcohol consumption. Therefore to complete data analysis, alcohol, life expectancy and GDP growth datasets were downloaded by country and linear regression analysis in Python was performed.
